# CyberPatriot-Scoring-Reports ([google drive with resources here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0))
## This repository holds my scoring reports for the CyberPatriot competition. 

## Note that this repository is a joke and there are no actual CyberPatriot scoring reports in this repository. If you're looking for them, please stop, that's against the rules.

note to self: keep this repository private to avoid breaking competition rules
